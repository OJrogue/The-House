## How to play
### Discord
How to host the bot:
1. Get the latest release of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install discord.py in console using:
   * Linux/macOS: `python3 -m pip install -U discord.py` 
   * Windows: `py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py`
3. Insert your bot token into `discord_bot.py` file
4. Run `discord_bot.py` \
(Unless modified the bot doesn't have any prefix and responds to all messages. I recommend to make a separate channel for the bot) 
### Command promt
Get the latest release of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\
