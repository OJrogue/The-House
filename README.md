## How to play
### Discord
You can join [my discord](https://discord.com/invite/4GtgYheGwM) to play there\
Or invite the bot to your server [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=827587619604267008&permissions=0&scope=bot). \
(Unless modified the bot doesn't have any prefix and responds to all messages. I recommend to make a separate channel for the bot) \
Or you can host the bot yourself:
1. Get the latest release of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install discord.py in console using:
   * Linux/macOS: `python3 -m pip install -U discord.py` 
   * Windows: `py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py`
3. Insert your bot token into `discord_bot.py` file
4. Run `discord_bot.py`
### Command promt

Run `game.py` to play!
